Uh We'll actually be able to, to to save some money and improve efficiencies, right? So the Microsoft dynamics will help us to improve efficiencies from a visibility standpoint when we're looking at the business overall and then having this five it staff to help expand my bandwidth and increase efficiency and from a team of what size is that right now?

Where, where are we spending too much time? When are we spending too much money. Um That's, that's gonna be, that's gonna be the key.

We're equipping you with the decisions to not just by 2020 make sure making sure that we're expanding that relationship and maintaining it just all throughout even past that meeting that you have at the end by 2020.

Obviously, that's where your role falls. I wanna make sure that it, it's just impacting your entire company too. So, whereas you may have a budget set for this project, I wanna make sure that's expanded out to the entire company. Now, you said that you kind of wanna be able to trim the fat, making sure you're doing that. Do you think that this project you're taking on is just for yourself or do you see it being spanned by the whole, the whole company.",
      "trait": "Conscientiousness"

      "transcript chunk": "SalesPerson 00:08:33.070\nOk. And you say cutting costs, where do you see yourself maybe having the most fat that you'd like to trip? I don't know.",

      "transcript chunk": "Buyer 00:08:39.479\nOk, that's why, that's why uh I think it's gonna be so important for us to launch Microsoft Dynamics and, and um and hire on this 55 staff. So that's why it's so important.",

      "transcript chunk": "SalesPerson 00:08:50.750\nSure. Yeah, and we would love to help you with that implementation. Uh That's something thing just seeing that, that way that you may able to implant that er P just really bringing everything together, able to trim that fab because especially in a large corporation like like yourself in your face. Absolutely. And you know, from everything that I've heard today and just the questions that you've been able to ask for me, I appreciate that. I know that the garner for Cio S tool would be something that's gonna help you reach that goal by 2020. Now, if we're able to show you how this tool can help you trim the fat and increase your revenue by 20% would you see value in implementing a tool like that?",
      "trait": "Conscientiousness"

    {
      "transcript chunk": "Buyer 00:09:25.820\nUh if, if you could do all of that?",

      "transcript chunk": "SalesPerson 00:09:28.510\nGreat, great. And I know just from that, I'm really excited to show it to you. I'm not just really passionate about garner, I'm also really passionate about Tobu too. I am a customer there with the extended tail shirt. Uh You know, I gotta say my friends really enjoy me wearing those. So they've been very thankful for that. So, so again, I just really know that, that this partnership would be something that could help you reach those goals, not just by 2020 but just continuing on that relationship over and above and beyond. One thing that we really do focus on again is research. I don't know if you've like we said, you haven't heard too much about Gardner, but you've seen a couple of the white pages. The research is really a big thing that we focus on at Gardner. So we make sure that we take on a third party approach in order to provide you which is detailed feedback, but also making sure it's unbiased, you're making the correct decisions in your field and in your role, but also doing them with a blind eye only focused on this research. This link right here is going to show you if we were to decide today what your personalized account would look like. When you conduct research, we have a portal that is designated specifically to your role specifically to what you want to accomplish by 2020. Just as an example, the research is easy to type in. If you just type in, for example, we want to show you Microsoft Dynamics. So if you just type in Microsoft Dynamics in there. And again, just showing you how it's on your personalized portal and you're able to search. So we have just with Microsoft Dynamics over 6000 articles that we can show you and pull research from. Do you see how that number could really begin to help you narrow down and focus on the trimming of the fat?",

    },
    {
      "transcript chunk": "Buyer 00:11:09.820\nUh Yeah, I mean, it, it's a lot of uh it's a lot of results. I mean, it would be a lot to go through. But yeah, I think it would be really, really interesting. Uh Me and my team are currently watching some different webinars and, and things like that. So um ok, I got you.",
      "trait": "Openness to Experience"
    },
    {
      "transcript chunk": "SalesPerson 00:11:25.669\nSo to clarify, you're maybe a little bit concerned about the number though and a lot of my customers do find that or have I felt that when they first see that result, you have members big like yourself. You have a lot of time, you don't have a lot of time on your hands to sit through all of them. You can type in a Google search result and you see a million Os at the bottom. You can't go through every single one. What our customers have found though is once we get them set up with their personalized portal, a the number of articles actually goes down because it has to be specific to retail, specific to your role. And b we really see the top three articles being the most pertinent to what you want to be doing? Not just in the short term as well. Does that clarify for you?",
      "trait": "Politeness"
    },
    {
      "transcript chunk": "Buyer 00:12:04.335\nYeah, that makes sense. And, um, you know, the, the research I'm sure would be, would be really helpful. But when it comes to doing the lunch itself, I wish I could speak to the research. Right? Is there, is there someone I could, I could speak to, to learn more about it or?",
      "trait": "Openness to Experience"

    {
      "transcript chunk": "SalesPerson 00:12:17.176\nAbsolutely. So would you find value then as someone that could help you walk through, just bouncing ideas off, that would be great, especially with me, with me trying to launch this, that would be really, really helpful. And one thing that we talked about about a little bit before and the reason why I know that Gardner for sales would be such a great fit for you is because we compare you with another seasoned person in retail. I know you spent over 30 years in the retail space, we can partner with a corporate executive. So part of our critical capability with the Gardner for Cio S is the executive partner. Now, the executive partner works for Gardner. But again, is a seasoned cio has, has been building that space and worked with it, particularly with retail. We're able to match it to them and you can bounce ideas off of them, whether it's implementation, looking at the research or even just wondering about office politics, they can really answer any question to you, we say monthly there. That's something we like. Just to keep a minimum of contact, there is no maximum, the number of times you can contact them. Does that tool really provide value for you? Can you see how that can help you analyze that research that you've got flown in?",

    {
      "transcript chunk": "Buyer 00:13:16.661\nYeah, I think that would really be able to help me to, uh, to, to, to, you know, vet out what I need to do for this launch. You can save me some time on the launch itself.",
      "trait": "Conscientiousness"
    },
    {
      "transcript chunk": "SalesPerson 00:13:26.599\nAbsolutely. Yeah. And again, a big thing like we said about Garner is saving you time. We want to make sure that you're able to not outsource but partner with Gartner, we're not doing your job for you. We're making your job easier and I'm sure it's a partnership to do that there too. Another thing we talked about there is your cost optimization saving on money if we're able to help generate revenue, but also cut costs for you. So we talked a little bit more about that. Um When you're right now, the technology vendors that you're dealing with when it comes to either customer side or internal, do you know off the top of your head? How many vendors are you typically dealing with?",

      "transcript chunk": "SalesPerson 00:14:24.239\nOk. Do you, uh, do you, would you say that maybe each contract? I usually see retail space being about $100,000 a ballpark estimate. You think that'd be?",

    {
      "transcript chunk": "Buyer 00:14:31.679\nI wish right now, I mean, we, we're paying about 300 1000 for, for just that single one. Yeah. Ok.",

    {
      "transcript chunk": "SalesPerson 00:14:40.479\nWell, let's be conservative. Let's just say 150,000. I know IBM might be a bigger contract of yours. I wanna show you right off the bat just from the current vendors you're using how Garner's customization tool can really help you out. So we are putting in, you said five vendors and we'll just play conservative and say 100 and 50,000 right off the bat where we're saving you is 84,000, 375. Just with the current contracts at a very conservative rate. That's an annual rate. And we know that as you continue to roll out this process, as new er P you'll be looking at analyzing more vendors. Not only do we have this cost organization tool, we have an it budgeting report something the executive can help you talk through comprehensive report that shows you just where you may be lagging behind where you're ahead of others in your industry and where you could be moving to, to really optimize your vendors. Do you see how number and that report can really again help you build that revenue and trim down areas you don't need to necessarily be investing so heavily in.",

And this new process you would consider a relationship with Gardner. Is that still the case? I would consider it if we were to get pen on paper today. As soon as I walk out that door, I would shoot you an email. You have my personal phone number right here at any time. You can call me except for maybe 2 to 3 in the morning. That's usually when I'm unavailable, but a reasonable time anytime you can call me.

You also have your team of 37 analysts. They will have or 37 it workers, they will have access to your reports if you would like to share it with them.

One where you think that the new people you're hiring on can just do that research and then on the other end you want it for maybe one year just right around the corner. Ok. And I'll just answer those on two parts of the, the last one first on Gardner. We don't do just a one year contract. We have a three year contract. The reason being because we don't give you the full experience of the package again at Garner, we don't just give you the product. We don't just make sure you're rolling this out one time and then we say hands off, we like it to be a relationship, making sure that yes, you're rolling this out. We're constantly there. You have your executive partner to talk through if anything may fail or if you need to update something, we're always there and available to provide you with that access to research. Now, with your it team, when we seek to do is not to replace their goals at all, we understand that you have your own corporate structure and we'd like to integrate with that, not replace. So one thing that we want to do with your growing team is help you build it out, help you have access to those research tools, help you have access to that cost optimization to make sure that you're that growth oriented mindset.

And I think this is going to be perfect for those 32 people that you have doing maybe research on how to make the company more efficient, etc as you mentioned. And so what these are is there's over 100 and 35,000 different research articles we have spanning many, multiple industries including your own. And so your team would be able to go in here and use this to find different articles based on your industry and with a matter of just hours or even days be reading through these articles and know how to increase the efficiency. Do you have to see how that could help?",
      "trait": "Conscientiousness"

    {
      "transcript chunk": "Buyer 00:11:13.659\nI mean, it sounds interesting, but my team is really strapped right now. So I'm not really sure how they'd have how we'd have time to put them to work and implement some of these right now. That's a lot, that's a lot of information. Yeah. And so we definitely need the information, but it just seems like a lot for, for them to cover being that they're already so tight. Yeah, just because it's a lot of information. Right. So, how am I going to get them to do stuff with that while we are already so busy?",
      "trait": "Conscientiousness"
    },
    {
      "transcript chunk": "SalesPerson 00:11:35.940\nOk. Ok. Well, you said they were really busy. Hopefully this would be almost a replacement to what they're currently doing now. Ok. So they wouldn't be having to do all that research outside different things like that. And I mentioned that, yeah, it's a lot of articles, but we have a filtering option where you can filter down to specifically maybe just two or three articles they can go through there and they can get all that research within a couple of hours vs maybe the days and that's going to free up a lot of their time. Does that make sense how it's going to help them create their time? And then the next part is you're trying to choose that, that system if you needed to, we have what's called our magic quadrant, which is going to generate a short list of vendors and leaders in that, in that industry. So you're going to know the best companies to buy this from. And then once you have that short list. This is actually my favorite tool, our critical capabilities, you'll be able to put in what's important to you and your company, which are called your critical capabilities. And then we'll rank those vendors based upon that. So you will get a vendor that does the best and what's important to you and it is going to help your business. You see how that could help you to make that decision quickly.",
      "trait": "Conscientiousness"
    },
    {
      "transcript chunk": "Buyer 00:12:36.869\nYeah, I mean, that seems that seems interesting. It could be very helpful in our process.",

    },
    {
      "transcript chunk": "SalesPerson 00:12:40.200\nYeah. Yeah. And then next thing I want to go over is what we call our cio executive partner. Now I want to mention this because in the past, I know a lot of people have found this extremely helpful in partnering with Gartner. And I mentioned specifically for you due to the decision you're having to make on the Microsoft um system for we, for our CIO executive partner. What we do is we'll partner you up with the CIO who has had over 25 years experience in your industry. So take David Hamilton, for example, I pulled him out of our database as I thought he'd be extremely helpful for you as he had, he's already had experience implementing Microsoft Dynam X AX for retail. He's had, he had to go through all the challenges the problems and so he would be able to come alongside you and tell you something about that. Maybe even just give you some suggestions on how to implement, to talk about his testing process and everything with me. Yeah, exactly. He'd be able to share all that information with you. He's even had some retail experience as VP of it and cio of these different companies. And so you'd be able to be paired up with one of these. You get one meeting a month, one meeting a year where they come to your company and they'll hang out with you and you can ask him all these questions as well as a once a month um webinar where you can ask questions and bounce ideas off of you see how this could help you to see how, yeah, you see that. Wonderful, wonderful. So considering that we've seen how the research tools and the executive partner could help you to make those. I'd like to go ahead and just jump into our budget tool really quick for you said you're trying to reduce that spend by 5% of that budget. And so what this is is it's going to take you just 30 minutes to two hours input information. You can even have someone else do it as long as they have the information. So it's gonna be super timely and then we're going to benchmark your budget versus the the leaders of the industry average. And so you'll be able to see on just a couple of pages where you're spending too much and where you can reduce that spend some customers, I think. Um, let me pull this out really quick, really quickly. Kevin Basconi over at Lands End, which is a similar industry. They found it's not on here but they found, um, oh yeah, it is sorry. They found over 23% savings on their budget the first time they used it. And so this is going to be helpful for that. It also shows it spending per employee a bunch of different things. 27 page report in just a matter of hours, there's that I can let you keep that, that's just a sample report as well as the testimonial. Just so you can see how some of the leaders in your industry have benefited from Gartner as well. Does that make sense? Do you see how that could help you to reduce that potentially?",

      "transcript chunk": "SalesPerson 00:15:11.700\nYeah, I know and I have customer after customer. I've even had them tell me that before as well. Like they think their budget is really tight. They're not really sure, but then they found 2030 even 43% savings on the budget. All right. So seeing how we can help you to reduce the budget, maybe free up your team for some time and then also maybe the executive partner could give you some help. I'd like to just jump into what the investment is required for this. And so for the first year for you, it's going to be $50,000 and then for any additional team members you want to add on, it's going to be 15,000 for each of them.",

And so Gartner, as I mentioned, a lot of these things will only take a couple of hours to a couple of days to use and they're going to be able to replace a lot of what you're doing now that's taking up a lot of time. So you'll be able to save that time and see that return on it, investment and reduce that budget by 5% maybe even 10 15%.",

And that cio partner continues to give them advice and value. And so we think that you get the most value out of garner when you use it for at least three years, which is the reason we require a three year contract.

So Garner is the world's leading it, research and advisory company working with over a 15,000 clients in more than 100 different countries. And we work with it, professionals like yourself to help them reach their mission critical priorities. So we do this with our product offering Gartner for Cio S, which you can see is made up of three separate parts based on the time we have and the information that you've shared with me. I'd love to talk about the first two, our research and our cost optimization. So with our research, you'll get access to our web portal which has over, which has over 100 and 35,000 research documents across 1300 topics in nine vertical industries. One of those is being retail. So we provide you with critical information to help you answer the most difficult questions, reducing your risk and ultimately making those complex situations that you're experiencing simpler. So I would love to explain how this works. And you access the web portal by going to our home page sign in up here in the top, right? But for this example, I went ahead and signed in, you'll click on the search bar and then you'll type in whatever you want. So just for a very general example, I'll type in omni channel. So whenever you type in omni channel, as you can see, we have almost 1000 results of documents that have been thoroughly vetted and reviewed by teams of analysts to make sure that there's relevance and value being provided for you and your organization. OK. So beyond this, once you become a client with Gartner, we'll implement your information and criteria to make this search even more relevant to Dubuque.

So you'll implement or you'll put that into your search bar and those documents will be based on previous companies that have implemented Microsoft A X and you can read through those, read through that information and really understand how other companies have made that successful. So you can make your implementation successful and I'll get into another part that is going to be able to help you better use this information shortly. OK.

So the second part is our cost optimization tools which I think you'll find a lot of value in because we can provide you with a hard dollar ro I So the first one being our it budget tool, which allows you to compare your key metrics within your it budget against industry averages to help you understand where you can better leverage your resources. So our database is made up of over 7000 data points making it the world's largest. And we're really able to help you make better decisions within that budget. So our report is over 25 pages in length. But based on the time that we have, I went ahead and printed out the summary page to give you a better understanding of what you'd be looking at. So I normally start up here on the top where we have percent spending or it spending as percent of revenue. But I challenge you to look down here with the it staffing. So as you can see, we have multiple different parts where your numbers would be compared to industry averages to help show you where you may be underfunded or understaffed. So you can have those conversations with your CEO CFO to really help them understand that you need more people.

Our executive partner is a prior cio who has had experiences like your own. And they're gonna work with you as a strategic partner to help you reach your goals. So this person will be able to bring a lot of advice and insight because they've been in your shoes before. They're also gonna have experiences that are gonna translate into areas where you may need a little bit of extra somebody to talk to or, or a little bit of extra help including using this product.

Well, based on the conversation we've had so far, I think it makes the most sense to go ahead and talk about price. So our garner price is laid out in a contract of over three years. First year being $50,000 2nd and third year increasing slightly. Wow, direct reports is another part of this. So with the regular spend, you will get your own seat access to all three parts.

OK. So the way that the partnerships with Gartner work is that it is a three year partnership. And so we don't do anything less than that. But there reason why is because what we've seen when we've partnered with all of our clients in the past is that they see a higher R I when they partner with this long term, a lot of the things that you're looking to accomplish, you're going to accomplish over the next three years. And so Microsoft Dynamics may take you even the next three years and you're not really sure yet, but we want to be there to walk alongside you every step of the way to make sure that you're hitting all of your goals and then to make sure that we can help you hit your goals and make sure that you're making the great confident decisions need so that your company realizes you have what it takes to be CEO one day and we want to be there to make sure that that happens.

    {
      "transcript chunk": "SalesPerson 00:13:18.830\nSo I'm going to highlight a couple of areas that I think are most specific to you. You kind of hit it with the research. We are known for that with Gartner, but to go into a little bit more of a detail and I'm just going to slide around a little bit is garner for CIO is designed to do three things, help you save time, save money and make confident business decisions. We do that by leveraging three services research, executive partnership and cost optimization tools. So I'm going to spend a little bit of time in our research and our cost optimization tools today because I think that they're going to be the areas that apply to you most especially in terms of say raising or hitting the revenue of 100 million. So I'm gonna put increase of 100 million and cutting costs by 23.5 million. I'm just gonna write a little in there. So we know that's a million. OK? So first I'm gonna go into is research, you said that your team has kind of narrowed it down a little bit into five different vendors that they're looking into. Do you have a pretty good idea and understanding of where you wanna go? But you're not, you're still not exactly sure yet. And so our research can help you get there and make sure that you're making the right choice in order to get that efficiency and hopefully that will lead to increased sales and profitability. So, the good thing about our research is that it's 100 percent unbiased and peer review. We have an independent approach to everything that we do. But what I want to highlight is that it's customizable to fit your needs. So you said that you've already had some vendor selected, which is great news for us and we can just further reassure you and the choices that you're making by offering some of our proven methodologies. So right here, I'm going to highlight our magic quadrant on here. You can see where all your vendors lie and their ability to execute and their vision to complete from there. We're going to break it down even farther for you and we're going to take it into critical capabilities. We'll pull up the companies and vendors you're looking at by a case by case scenario. So you can figure out what is most important to you here at Dubuque. And then we're going to tell you why we ran them the way that we do in the different case studies. So what's one case study you'd be interested to hear about.",
      "trait": "Conscientiousness"

    {
      "transcript chunk": "Buyer 00:15:17.109\nUm I think like out of these vendors, you're saying, oh, not out of these ones specifically, like it would obviously be people who can help you in assisting with the implementation of Microsoft Dynamics but maybe like the connectivity of it all or like the hybrid ness of it all are different case studies that we can bring it up by and then we rank them on their ability to accomplish all that. Yeah, like maybe a case study on did the cheapest one actually do the job.",
      "trait": "Conscientiousness"

      "transcript chunk": "SalesPerson 00:15:44.650\nAnd so that's something that we could definitely look into and break it on why we rank it that way. Do you see how that could help reinforce that you're making the right decision moving forward? Yeah, it could be helpful. OK. And so where I'm going to spend most of my time is going to be in the cost optimization tools. So you're looking to save quite a bit of money that's also going to help in helping you reach the $100 million that you're looking for while saving that 23.5. So we have two tools that we're going to talk about today. The first is our it budget comparison. And so this allows you to take your budget that you're currently working with, compare it against industry averages and we can see where you're overspending or underspending and that will empower you to go back and look at different areas you have opportunities to save.

      "transcript chunk": "SalesPerson 00:16:43.030\nWell, it does compare it against the other in industry averages. But where I think you might get the most value is you're looking to implement and work with a few new people to help you in implementing Microsoft Dynamics, as well as implementing Microsoft Dynamics. And we have people who are do nothing but review contracts, they review hundreds of contracts a week, they can go through and find hard dollar savings for you. So three out of four contracts we partner with, we save on average 15 to 20%. So what's an average size contract that you currently partner with?",

Do you see how that would help in assisting you in getting one step closer to saving that 23.5 million Yeah, I mean, if, if you can actually deliver on that, then, then of course, I like to think that I'm not over paying for things.",

I put their phone number at the bottom, please reach out to them so you can trust them and take their word for it. Not fine. Now, we are running a little bit low on time. So I'm going to go into what the investment portion of Gardner looks like. So, uh partnership with Gardner, I like to call it a Garner S sorry, it's going to be a three year partnership like we talked about before. I like to compare it to a cell phone plan.

And then from there, you just kind of go into starting a partnership with Gartner. We talked about a lot of things today, you know, we talked about how we're going to help you in making the right choice. So you get Microsoft Dynamics to increase your efficiency. We also spoke about a couple of ways where we can save you money without really having to change anything you're currently doing with the contract review services that's going to not only empower you to hit that goal in the next three years, but maybe you can add some more of the staff that you were looking to, you know, you wanted to add 10 people and this might help you in terms of making sure that you're getting there and doing that.

From what you told me today, I think this is really the best, the best choice for you for a few different reasons. One you know the reason what this is is a database of thousands of documents, thousands of on site analysts and vendor selection tools in order to give you the best bang for your buck and really choose that vendor selection process and save that time there. You see a lot of time savings. In addition to that you have the cost optimization tools and what this really is is a collection of the it budget tool, the it metric data. And really importantly the contract review service where we find a lot of cost savings, as you mentioned earlier, you want to be cost effective. So I have to introduce that. Finally, we have an executive partnership program which pairs you with an ex cio or deprive you and unbiased and really put me of quality second opinion. Do you have any questions about this?",

Well, let's talk a little bit about the research portion because you said huge concern for you right now is this Microsoft Dynamics ax? Right? So before I came, I actually, you know, just Googled in our system, excuse me, not Google, I search in our system, Microsoft Dynamics AX. And this is just a screenshot I briefly took there as you can see there is around 243 results. And if you were to go on Google, it would be about 14 million results. And there's a reason for that you're a smart guy, you're in the technology industry, you know that on Google or on Bing, on any of the sort of search engines you're doing, it's all biased research. It's all provided by people that are paying money to get in front of your face, right? So all these 243 results will all be completely verified and you'll be able to do all the research that you ask there with the Microsoft Dynamics. For instance, you want to know about implementation, you'll be able to look in this actual search tool, Microsoft Dynamics AX implementation. And instead of going to the implementation site that Microsoft puts out you're going to be able to know. OK. What does this actually do for my business? How do I actually implement it?

Well, so again, you said you had a few questions about Microsoft Dynamics AX mation was a big one as I showed you for this search tool. Another thing you can do with Microsoft Dynamics AX within our garner software is look at the vendor ratings. As you said, you have, you want to increase it by three years, right? So that's a long term, that's a long term goal. A lot of times these vendors, it's a huge debate between, is it a short term solution or is it a long term solution? This is where the vendor ratings would come in and this is a survey providers and the options in the market. I'm going to give you an exact estimate on how they would stack up versus risk in the long term. So you'd be able to type in, you know, you'd be able to learn a little bit more about Microsoft Dynamics ax within this vendor rating system and it would rank all the different procedures and products they have from week to straw in order to give you that long term view that not something you'd benefit from.",

Yeah, I'm sorry. Yeah, the budget and you have $500,000 in current vendor contracts. Is that correct? Great. Well, again, you're telling me cost savings is super important and I totally agree there. So, what I'd like to do is talk to you a little bit more about our, our contractor view service. Actually, I think I buried it in here. Here we go. So this is within our cost optation tool. As I mentioned, just one piece of that is our contractor view service. And what we find is we find an average savings of 20% in three out of four contracts. So you mentioned you have 500 dollars in current contracts. So I'm going to do the math here for you. So that's $500,000 and I'm going to times it by 0.75 to look at 3/4 of those. So you're looking at about 375,000. And if we have an average saving of 20% on those, that'd be just $75,000 in estimated savings just from our contract of use service within there. So, I mean, that's the cost that you're spending, that you don't need to, as you mentioned earlier. I mean, you want to be cost effective. Do you think that would be beneficial for you?",

Finally, I like to talk to you a little bit more dive into that cost ization tool a little bit there. So you mentioned to me that, you know, it would, we want to see where we're currently spending, we want to see what our staffing looks like. We have something called the it budget, the it staffing tool. What that is is the it staffing tool allows you to actually look at where you're currently spending the money on the staff members in order to allocate that money and again, be more cost effective and that's super important to you as well. And I also have a screenshot for you for the it budget tool. This is the same thing except instead of the staffing, it's the budget. So for instance, here I have just a quick screenshot here. It's got, you know, let's say you website data center, hardware software, it shows you how much you're spending, for instance, hardware about 15%. And the industry average is spending about 18% or on the on the opposite end you're spending or overspending and you should be spending lower than that amount and that gives you a really good insight and benchmarking, as you mentioned to be cost effective.

So we can see specifically where we need to cut some of the costs, maybe where you're overspending.

So the first thing that I would love to share with you is our research methodologies. So you mentioned that you're currently um you're considering Microsoft dynamics, but you need to make a selection in a vendor to increase efficiency. So you can give your customers better experience. Well, in our methodologies, we'll help you with that decision. Um You said you want to have this by the end of the year. And so what we do is that we look at all the vendors out there, um We look at them according to your company, your goals and what you're trying to accomplish in that. And so we cut through all of the noise to find what's relevant to you. And so we end up populating a short list of vendors that you should actually consider your time and I know time is very scarce. So what this means for you is that we'll end up populating a very short list of vendors that you should actually consider. And then we'll help you move into the action, actionable steps to implement this so that you're not making the wrong decision, you won't have to backtrack and you'll be confident in that you are making the correct vendor selection so that you can implement this at your company to work towards that increase in revenue of $94 million.

Right now, you're working with a $7 million budget and we chatted about probably closer to 10 to 11, maybe even upward of 14 would be more efficient for how you're operating in your it budget. But we can populate this report for you, take about an hour to show how you're currently allocating your resources versus best practices in your industry. And so you'll be to see where you should reallocate your resources. Um but also killing two birds with one stone. This report you'll be able to have with you to help build your case um and build that stronger relationship with your teammates and your fellow C suite members. And this is how we're operating.

I've known Garner for the last year and a half and those of you haven't met yet and I specialize in specially retail and apparel and so specialize in account similar to, well, I guess nobody is really similar to debut. You have your own way of doing things that are one of a kind. Truly. Ok. Well, I guess there's a lot of us in here today so I don't wanna take up too much of your time. I'm sure you are all extremely busy and I have some medias coming up.

So you all came in at the perfect and so all we really talked about last time was the budget. So throughout this meeting, what I'd love to cover some of the big initiatives and goals that Dubuque is facing um or spearheading and then kind of how the it department plays into those CFO CMO, please feel free to add anything that you have going on right now. Does that sound ok with you all? Is there anything that anybody would like to add to that agenda? Ok. Well, then, you know, let's go ahead and get started. Why don't we um look at the decision cycle for a moment, you know, I like to cover this in all my big meetings, but if we did decide to move forward in a partnership with Gardner in Dubuque, which I would be really excited about.

If it doesn't, my neck is a little bit, you know, on the line. Um You know, I think we're a super collaborative company. It's what makes us who we are and I guess why I wanted to bring Eric and Brian is just because I think the things I have going on and what um you know, in my world are actually critically important to powering their organizations.

And um the, the thing there is we've sort of hit a roadblock and almost like a fork in the road. We can go left or right and the decision is, should we build or should we die? Um You know, if we're gonna build a platform internally or, or, or buy from some vendor externally. And I think the second thing that that's, you know, always on top of our mind, um maybe tangentially related to this is uh cutting operational costs by 5%.",

So I just wanna make sure I have everything correct so far. Um One of the biggest things that are all working towards right now, this includes everybody is a 15% increase in revenue. So $80 million is what we're looking to have in the bank by January 1st of 2020. Correct? Ok. And then we're going to be doing that by a couple of different ways. First of all, increasing the customer experience and you're looking to do that through ecommerce, whether you build or buy a platform. Is that correct?",

      "transcript chunk": "SalesPerson 00:08:57.679\nWell, I think it depends on a few different things. And so I want to ask a couple more questions about that, but just to confirm the last big goal is that you need to cut costs across the company by 15 million. Ok. Just wanted to confirm that, make sure I have the three big things that we're looking for. So as far as builder by a platform, I mean, that goes based off of a lot of different things, you know, a lot of different roles come into place at that. So, um I guess the biggest thing is what are you looking for in a platform to give your customers the best experience, what's important to you?",

      "transcript chunk": "Buyer 00:09:26.409\nYeah, I mean, I think, I think infinite time we could build and buy the same thing that can accomplish the same things.

And I think, you know, I know you feel strongly about this but it's, it's got to be around, it's just got to work and it's got to be, it's got to be consistent to me.",

      "transcript chunk": "Buyer 00:09:48.450\nOk. Yeah, we can, can't be changing it a year from now. So, you know, I think it's important whatever we choose, we, it's a important decision because it's going to impact our company for the next couple.",

Well, you know, I don't think you have to worry about about that, but I do think what we have to worry about is whether or not I even have enough staff to do this. And um but at the end of the day, if you come to me after we buy something and tell me it's not everything you need it. You know, me, I'm a tinkerer. I like to get in there and I'm going to wish that I could have built that thing and done what you need it. The problem is, but I don't know if I can get that done in a short time.

If you think about it, you've got about eight months now as well as cutting 15% of all operational costs across the company. How confident are you all just to correct that we got to grow by 80 million, we cut costs by 5%. Yes, and that's 15 million. Ok.

So, I mean, I think that when there's value with something that it depends on what you're looking to spend. But I think that with Gartner, there's a lot of ways that you can save. And so throughout the presentation today, I'm going to build that value for you to show you that when you're looking at Gartner from the outside, it may look like it costs a lot, but really what you're getting for and the amount of quality and the amount of ro I that we're going to get you in return, you really pay nothing for Gartner.

They're fans of the Blue Gardener. And so I actually brought with me, um someone that I worked with previously Michelle Jacobs. Um and she talks about this in her testimonial right here about her experience with Gardner and how she really enjoyed it. And so I put her phone number at the bottom because I'm the kind of person like even when I go out to eat food, I don't trust the restaurant anymore. I'm looking at y'all and so don't take my word for it. Take hers, reach out to her and hopefully she can help clarify some of those concerns for you as well. And when you're working with me, I'm always here for you as well. So every step of the way I'll be here, I hope that helps clarify some of your concerns going into it as well. Let me do a quick brief overview of Gardner. I'm sorry that this is a little bit small for three people. Um I'll do my best to be a white for you. Alright. So with Gartner, I like to really make this simple for you. Garner for Cio S is yes, we are the leading research and it advisory company in the world right now. We partner with 73% of the Fortune 500 companies. So we do have a lot of people that we are working with. But in simple terms, our goals are we're here to help you save time, save money, make competent business decisions. In short, your goals are our goals. And so the way that we do that is by leveraging three different tools, research, cost optimization tools and executive partners. So I spend a couple a little bit more time in a couple of areas today because I think that's where you're going to see the most value for your money, gentlemen. And so we're gonna talk about cost optimization tools. You have some big goals ahead of you as far as money and budgets go, I'm sure that's music to your ears. Um We're looking to grow by $80 million and we're looking to cut by 15 million kind of like an oxymoron there, but we can make that happen for sure. And, and then um we're looking to make a big decision on whether or not we buy or build a platform for the company that's gonna last us years to come and work with our growth. So I was in some area and some time I researched today. Does that sound? OK, gentlemen. All right. So let's go ahead and get into it. So the first area we're gonna talk about is gonna be research, obviously right now, we're kind of stuck between a builder bi situation right now. And so what that means, the reason why the research can benefit you is because we take an independent unbiased approach. So everything that we produce right now is going to be 100% unbiased. We have analysts that work around the clock. This is their job to write this. They have 15 to 20 years of experience in the field. So they are experts on what they're writing about. So I don't even have phd. So you're looking at getting information from doctors knowing that you have a very reliable sources.",

So it sounds like some of the issue maybe uh in result to some of the research that you've been doing? You said you've been watching some webinars, you and the team have trying to find out, you know, some information or strategies upon implementing uh Microsoft Dynamics. Is that correct? Ok. Would you be interested in hearing a little bit about some of the research that Gartner provides that may be beneficial for you? Sure, perfect. Have you heard about Gardner's package, Gardner for CIO S at all? Essentially, it has three different parts. The one that I want to show you here to start is uh a research package. Uh So what we can do here is this is actually on a web portal that you would have access to is you can simply search in here something we're interested in getting more uh research and information on. We have over 1900 analysts that are continually searching the web, writing, writing and creating data for you to use in your business and your decision making. So if you could use or type in the search bar for me be um even type Microsoft Dynamics. OK. So MS Dynamics, I'm gonna go ahead and change that for you to Microsoft and see what we come up with here. OK? That you see over 6000 results, over 6.5 1000 results on Microsoft Dynamics. OK. So some of this information is going to be directly applicable for you. And you know, is it the best opportunity for your business as well as if? So how do we implement it correctly? Does that sound of value to you at all?",

    {
      "transcript chunk": "SalesPerson 00:08:44.570\nAbsolutely. So it has some of the vendor ratings, minimize costs and risks mitigating all of that. And this is all unbiased. Um, basically research that we do, like I said, over 1900 employees, we're not tied to any specific vendors. So it's just purely a data format for you to go ahead and utilize in your decision making. Does that make sense? Yes, great. Is this something that you're interested in at all?",

    {
      "transcript chunk": "SalesPerson 00:09:13.809\nSo in addition to that, one of the tools of research is called the hype cycle. Have you heard of this at all before? Yeah. OK. So the hype cycle basically considers all of the factors internally and externally upon implementing new technology decisions or investments in your business. So with Microsoft Dynamics, I've heard of people that have really had a great return on their investment in it and also people that, you know, maybe it wasn't the best decision for them. So the hype cycle really helps show us a few different things. So number one, I think that's the most applicable here. The second void is reducing the risk of technology investment decisions. OK. So within implementing Microsoft Dynamics for you, it's going to be very important to understand. Is this the right timing? Is this the right decision for the business. And if so what is the best way to do it? Does that make sense at all? Sure. OK, great. So uh that's basically the research aspect of Gartner for Cio S. Additionally, I'd like to show you in some of the cost savings, some of our cost optimization tools. Um Do you guys have a lot of vendor contracts that you're looking to uh save costs on? Is that something you're interested in?",

So we're able to gather market averages to see where are you overspending and where are you ahead of other competitors in the retail industry? OK. So with this example, some this shows with the it staffing 6.5% in 2017 and 18 was spent on the staffing of their overall budget and the market average is about 3%. So there it shows that they're spending over double the cost which helps them understand. OK. Here's where we need to eliminate some of the costs. Find out how to be more efficient. Does that make sense to you at all?",

      "transcript chunk": "SalesPerson 00:11:23.469\nFantastic. So last thing I have for you is obviously moving forward. You need someone or you probably need some assistance or advice on how to implement Microsoft Dynamics. The correct way, right? That's what you're looking for in a third party. Is that right? Val? Ok. So we do have in the third part of our package, the um executive partner. So essentially we have CIO S our previous CIO S that have done this before. They've worked as a CIO and they've been very successful in it. And this way, what we can do is we can actually set them up to help you and assist you in moving uh Microsoft Dynamics into your business if we realize it's the best fit from the hype cycle. Does that make sense? Right. OK. Is that something that you would find interesting at all? Sure. OK. Do you have any questions on any of that? Yeah. OK. So moving forward, um do you think this is something that you would be interested in partnering with Gartner before? Um you know, moving Microsoft Dynamics into it just depends how much does it cost? Absolutely. So I can go over some of the pricing with you as well. Um It's a licensing agreement. Are you familiar with that at all? Please educate me. Yes. So a licensing agreement is going to be basically a partnership between the two of us for the next three years. Um Is how long that we do it for at um our company? So the first year, it's gonna be $50,000. The second year is gonna be uh 51.5 and the third year is 53.1 grand. Ok. So is there anyone aside from just you that would be looking to utilize some of the research cost optimization tools at all? Just you? Perfect. So wouldn't have to purchase any additional licenses or anything like that. Those would be the straight cut costs. How do you feel about those prices? It's a multi year agreement. Yes, correct.",

Um With that being said, everything we've talked about, I'd love to just recap and show you where I believe Gardner could potentially provide that value. So, so far you've told me that you're looking to invest in a third party uat service in order to, you know, test that the implementation of Microsoft dynamics is going to meet Dubuque's business requirements. In addition, you overall Dubuque needs to cut their costs by 25 million. Your timeline is looking ASAP, you told me. So really, you're determining how you can choose the best vendor, cut your budget by 25 million and defend the reasoning for hiring five new it staff. Is that all correct? Ok. So everything we've, we've talked about, I'd love to show you where Garner can help. Would you be interested in learning about a few tools like? All right, great. So the product we offer is called Gartner for Cio S. It includes three main core capabilities including our Gartner research, our cost optimization tools and our executive partner program. So I'd like to start with our Gartner research. Ultimately, our research is going to help our clients make the right technology decisions quickly and accurately. The first time we do this by simplifying the challenges they're facing and laying them out in a visual format. Not only that our research is completely independent, vetted and objective. So what this means is any bias you might be receiving regarding which third party uat service to go with Gartner is not gonna have that. We're simply just gonna match you with the best possible vendor. So I'd like what I'd like to do right now is give you a quick demonstration of our Gartner research portal. So this is exactly what it will look like. And if it's all right with you, I'm actually going to have you test in type in type in. All right, if it's OK with you, I'm gonna have you type in for me. It's a big one. Are you ready? User acceptance testing? Retail user, I didn't know I was gonna have to do all this work.",

I'd just like to cover one more thing which is our cost optimization tools. So Gartner has assembled the world's largest database of it metrics. So what this means for you is we're going to be able to provide you with that great frame of reference of where you need to be in terms of maximizing profitability. So this is an example of our it budget tool. It's 27 pages. And for the sake of time, I know we don't have the time to go through it all now, but I'd love to leave it with you. However, I would like to highlight page four. What it is is a self assessment where you'll input your current it budget and then it's going to stack you against other peer organizations and those considered best in the industry. So if we look at this example, you can see that they've input their 2017 and 2018 budget and the industry averages are on the right. As you can see, it'll say it spending as a percentage of revenue and they're spending about 2.4 whereas the industry average is 4.3. So it's gonna give you that, you know, defend ability that you're looking for in order to, you know, say we need to be spending money in order to maximize profitability. The best part is I know you mentioned that you need to hire five new, it staff, it covers it, staffing. So if Dubuque is to be under underspending and staffing, you're gonna have those clear and concise answers of why you need five more, five more people on your staff.

So not only can we do that for the third party uat service you're gonna go with, we can also look at that big contract with Microsoft Dynamics three in every four contracts, garner reviews, we find hard dollar savings of 15 to 20%.

So before we talk about that, I'd just like to restress that essentially you've told me that your deadline is ASAP with that being said, that's obviously not a real deadline, but I can appreciate that you need this done immediately. Making this investment with micro Microsoft Dynamics is going to be a big one. It's going to help you cut costs and essentially make sure that you're having a seamless transition. So that is why the third party uat provider is going to be critical to making sure that everything is going to run the way you hope it does. So with that being said and making sure that you're making the right decision the first time, as well as allocating your budget where you need to be and defending that you need those five it staff, this is what the initial investment is going to look like.

I wanted to briefly mention an aspect of Gardner and what I found is that when it comes to research and new technology such as an EP system, those often involve contracts.

And so if we're talking about a million dollar contract for this, what would be a Microsoft system here? That's $150,000 in hard cost savings that could be put toward initiatives such as making sure this ERP system is, is a success or even to that $350,000. That's a significant chunk of that.

On top of that, you mentioned that your team is really strapped right now for time and we're spending upwards of 40 hours a week on this system. And there are other areas where they could be using their time more effectively. And also, of course, with the $350,000 cost cut, it's a big goal. And right now, we're trying to find ways in which we could find that if you could rate your situation to me on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being, you know, I feel like, you know, I'm up late at night thinking about how I'm going to achieve these goals. 10 being, I feel like I've got a pretty good handle on things.

      "transcript chunk": "SalesPerson 00:11:41.189\nSure. Absolutely. And you know, that's understandable to be kind of in the middle and always compete being open mind of how we can do things. But my goal is to consult with Garner is to make sure my clients are closer to that level of 10. And if I could provide you with a solution to make sure this ERP system gets up and running and is successful as well as provide a way to cut 5% from your budget or specifically $350,000. Would that be a solution you'd be interested in learning more about? Yeah, I can see the Absolutely. Well, then again, how we do that, how I make sure that my clients are closer to that level of 10 actually through a three pillar system at Garner, this includes our research, our cost optimization and our executive partner program using these three tools, we're able to identify an average of 38% cost savings in our client's budget over their competition for the exact same workload leading to double digit growth for our clients. From this, I would actually like to focus our attention on the first two, which is our research and our cost optimization. So do you mind if I actually swing around and show you the gardener solution in action? So first I wanted to show you the research that we mentioned and what it comes down to a Gardner is we have a 33 pillar approach to make sure that we answer three critical components or three critical questions for executive directors such as yourself and that is who what and when? So first, I want to answer the all important question of who at Gardner, we have a magic quadrant which breaks down exactly who provides the vendors that provide technology that we're looking for. So specifically with your ERP system, this tool can identify exactly who is out there that can provide that technology. So we can ensure that this is the right technology for us at this time. If you could actually give me one swipe to the left, please. Yes, this brings up our second tool which is our critical capabilities graph. Using this, we answer that all important question of what, what are these vendors good at and how, how well does that match to what I'm trying to get out of the technology? And if you could give me one more swipe to the left please. This is our hive cycle which answers that important question of when, when should we be implementing this technology? As I'm sure you have come across the technologies that we implement today? Technology changes so much that five years down the road, we can't guarantee that that system is going to be viable. So this gives us the best estimation of when is the right time to be implementing these technologies specifically with this, with your ERP system, we can ensure that this system is going to get up and running as a success and take some of the pressure off those 32 members, your team. We're spending 40 hours a week on this project and that I think that you would be able to optimize our time in more efficient ways.

    },
    {
      "transcript chunk": "SalesPerson 00:14:17.625\nAnd I did also want to briefly touch on the cost optimization, As I had mentioned at Gardner. We actually, if you give me 20 minutes of your time, we can create a total breakdown of your budget to identify exactly where you can be cutting from that budget. So first, I want to show you a questionnaire that we have, this breaks down all of your financial information. And from that, we created 27 page report, it's a hefty report about everything of cost savings about your budget. And this is just an example for you, but I don't want to focus too much on the 27 pages because we actually have an executive summary that puts things into more perspective. So I'd like to show you a bit of a breakdown here. This, this chart essentially breaks down your budget everywhere that you're spending, which we found from the, the, the questionnaire. And we're able to identify specifically where you're spending and benchmark that against industry average. So as an example, I'd like to show you the data center here. We have 25% that we're spending. Whereas the industry average is 20% interesting. That could be a red flag for us that potentially there's 5% of overspend there, which is a great way to identify where we could be cutting costs to reach that 5% or $350,000 of cost cut this year.

But the reason we prefer not to just do one project and done is because we want to be a partner with your business and make sure we can help you not only reach this goal but also drive that revenue. So only implementing Microsoft A X isn't going to help you within three years. It could help you driving the revenue, but you also have to do your staffing.

The second is whether you're gonna build internally or buy into vendors and it's going to require that you look at new vendors and lastly, you need to reduce overhaul operational costs within every department.

Would each of you be interested in learning about a few tools that can help ensure you're going to meet your deadline of January 2020 get the jobs you need to get done. Alright. So the product we offer is called Garner for Cio S. It includes three main deliverables including our Gartner research, our cost optimization tools and our executive partner program based off what we've talked about today and your current it needs. I'd really like to focus on our Gartner research and our cost optimization tools. So ultimately Gartner is able to completely independent and objective research to our clients. It's gonna help you make the right technology decisions quickly and accurately. The first time I noticed that you guys earlier said that it would be detrimental to your budget and each of almost your jobs, I hate to say it. But if you aren't able to find the answers you're looking for, so Gardner is going to be able to simplify the issues facing you're facing and lay them out in a visual format and give you exactly the answers you're looking for. So what I'd like to do right now is show you what our G research portal looks like. So I noticed that we talked about value, so value with your customers. So how about you type in for me, customer value retail because you guys are in the retail industry and this is just quickly to demonstrate how easy it is to find exactly what you're looking for quickly. I know you guys mentioned that, you know, you're kind of almost not arguing. I know you guys said you have great working relationships, but there is a little bit of a battle in determining whether to build internally or externally. So does this portal with completely independent objective and applicable information?

We cover research across nine vertical industries and retail is one of them, 19 of the 25 Big Box retailers, trust Gartner research, as well as 75% of the global 500 our executive partner program, which I'd love to touch on at the next meeting for the sake of time is actually somebody who's going to be your liaison between the research or finding and how to leverage garner tools, but also their trusted advice.

So, is that all correct? Yeah. Is there anything that we didn't touch on about your situation that you think is important for me to know now that I'm thinking of great.

And maybe um you know, increasing your customer satisfaction, would you be interested in learning more? Absolutely great. So I do before we delve into the specifics about how we can increase your revenue. I do like to take just a little bit of a step back, talk about all that you get with Gardner. OK? So the solution that I think makes the most sense for your situation is Gardner for Cio S. So I personally love this solution because it can help um dubuque with its three most valuable assets, you know, your time, your money and give you peace of mind while making business decisions. OK? So we have our research tools which helps your people save time while enabling the best decision making our cost optimization tools helps your business effectively allocate its financial resource, which I love to talk about in a bit. And we also have our executive partner who's a trusted mentor to help you both personally and professionally along the way. So I want to start with our cost optimization tools because I think it makes the most sense for your situation. So you told me that a primary goal for you most hot button issue is to increase your revenue by 20%. So our cost optimization tools comes with two main components that kind of help you do that our it but tool is the world's largest database of comparative it metrics that helps your business benchmark against the best in the industry. So this allows you to cut costs, identify places of investing for revenue generation and you know, make that case for hard dollar savings and in investing but taking a look at, you know what that kind of looks like how we can use this tool. Uh It's a 20 minute self assessment and you input all of your budgetary information and garden will spit out a custom report so we can take a look here. Now, this is just an example. But if we're looking here, this is your organization stacked up against the best of the industry. And we can see here as an example, your it spending as a percent of revenue for an example is 2% while the best in the industry is spending over four. So you can automatically there identify places where you're under investing, where you should be spending some more resources and you can make a case for that. But not more importantly, you know, we do both sides of the coin. So not only are we giving you places to invest, we also show you places of overspending. So where are you maybe spending too much and you can cut a little bit and to push it back into some revenue generating activities. So by just by using these tools, you know, our customers see that they can save up to 43% of their it costs, which is really powerful and which will really help you, you know, along the road when you wanna become CEO and you really want to show um powerful statistics, this is going to help you do that. It's going to help to reduce costs in the day to day activities you're doing and improve efficiency overall, which I know you said is really important. So does everything make sense about the it budget tools I've explained it. Does, can you see the value in using this? Could you see yourself using it at a trading company?",

    {
      "transcript chunk": "SalesPerson 00:10:38.119\nDefinitely. And that's something you can take a look at. Uh another component of our cost optimization tools are, is our contract, a new service. So our analysts uh analyze thousands of contracts every single year to make sure that you're getting the best terms on the best price, which ultimately allows you to know not to be spending too much in areas where you, where you don't need to be. So we do this through two main facets. So we do a pricing analysis, make sure that you're getting the best money and you're paying the best price. We also do a business terms review. So we look at all the fine print and make sure that you're getting the best terms. And what this ultimately allows you to do is have some negotiation strategies with those vendors. So just by using these tools, you know, we can save our customers. We've seen an average of 15 to 20% on every three out of four contracts, but I like to break this down as we can save you an average of 10% on every contract. Do you have any questions about the contract review tool? No, sure. Can you see yourself using it? Do you see the value in the contract review service?",

It's billed annually starts at $50,000 for the first year goes up about 3% every year after that. Just to make sure we're getting you most updated information. We add thousands of documents every single year. We also have a direct report license. I know you mentioned you have a team and it's growing, we have a direct report license, gives them access to our research tools and our cost op tools for $15,000 each year. And it also goes up about 3%. But you know, I know you want to talk about RO I and that's one of the main criteria in making a decision. So I'd love to get more into that.

So imagine, I mean, I want to talk through, you know, some more points. Is that right? If I move on and kind of discuss some more. Sure. So we have um our cost optimization tools. I talked a little bit about that already. So you've mentioned that your current it spending is about 7 million. Is that correct? So, with our it budget tool, you know, we've seen that we can save up to 43%. But let's say conservatively, we can only save you 20 we're still saving you over $1.4 million on your it budget. Our next component that we talked about is that contract, your service? You said you have a couple of vendors. Um How much would you currently say you're spending in contracts with the current vendors?",

      "transcript chunk": "SalesPerson 00:15:02.020\nSure. Well, just to give you the number, you know, if we're saving you on those contracts that you currently have, you're saving $90,000 just there alone in the contract that you're, you're already a part of. And what percentage do you take for that? So we, we like to say that we can save you an average of 10%. So taking an average of 10% of all those contracts that you're in um turns out to be about $90,000. So another component that we have that we didn't get a chance to talk about what comes with our package is our research tools. So this gives you ultimately access to our information. And what do you need to make better business decisions is good information. So we have information that's unbiased. We don't sell or invest in any of the technologies that we cover. Our information is reliable. We've been selling information for 40 years and if people couldn't rely on us, you know, we wouldn't still be around today. And we also have information that's actionable. So it takes all this big data that can be hard to analyze, sometimes break it down so you can make better decisions more quickly today as opposed to tomorrow. So how much time would you say your, your team currently spends researching?",

      "transcript chunk": "Buyer 00:16:01.580\nUm So that just depends. I mean, right now we look at different webinars, we watch instructional videos, we have different research, infographics, fact sheets and my papers. I don't really keep track of, of timing though, right?",

      "transcript chunk": "SalesPerson 00:16:16.539\nIf you could just ballpark in a given week, how much would you, how, how many hours would you say you spend? I'm not sure. Sure. So in the past, you know, just working with other clients, we've seen an average of 10 hours per week. I mean, would you say that's a fair estimate? We can do that? Sure. So if we're saving you, you know, we've seen that we can save customers an average of 38% of that time. So if we save you, you know, 38% of that in a given week, that's almost four hours. So over the course of the month, this is 15 hours of time saved for your team. And where this really gets impressive is over the course of the year, we can save you over 100 and 80 hours of their work week. So ultimately, you know, this breaks down to about 4.5 extra week of added time to your whole entire year. You know, what could your team do with an extra four weeks of time? So our last and final component that comes with your package is our executive partner. This gives you access to a seasoned cio with an average of 15 experience, uh years of experience in your industry. You get access to them through a yearly on site visit as well as a minimum point of contact of 60 minutes. And so this is just what I like to think of as, you know, insurance, you don't always need them, but when you do, they're there and you insure your house, you insure your car, but why not insure your business decisions? And this will really help you, you know, um make sure that you can make business decisions that are sound and you want to make it to CEO one day. So why not, you know, have someone to guide you through that and get you to that path. So we really like to think of this as invaluable, you know, because what is your peace of mind worth and what is, you know, business decisions worth to you? So keeping all these things in mind, you know, I've shown you how we can save you time, shown you how we can save you money and we give you peace of mind all while paying for ourselves.

What's great about what Gartner does is we're leading more in research and advisory firm. We are actually recently one of the world's most admired companies in 2019 by Fortune 500 which is great. Now, based on our conversation, I know you'd like a hard ro I and I believe the product that's going to benefit you the most is going to be Garner's for Cio. Now, it's going to have three different components that you just mentioned are going to be right along with everything we're trying to accomplish. The first thing, research that's going to help you have that reliable technology in order to go live in 2020 start implementing as soon as possible. The other tool is going to be cost optimization tools are going to help you reduce that budget by 5% which is going to be really important in order to hire more employees and a cio partner that's going to help you utilize this package to its full capability. That's also going to be a feature. How are you feeling so far regarding I'm interested to hear? Great. Now, I know you mentioned research is going to be really important to you. So I'd love to tell you a little bit more about that. So our research is completely unbiased, taking actual results regarding your industry and turning it into actionable action, really being able to save time money, which is really important to you and mitigate risk taking on such a large product.

      "transcript chunk": "SalesPerson 00:08:47.375\nOk, perfect. Let me show you exactly how our research can save you time. Now, you are trying to implement a project that is going to be really large and you are trying to take on some help, assistance from different vendors that you need to trust. Now, garner has many different methodologies. One being the magic quadrant, which I'm a true fan of, I would never get tattoos. But if I can, this would be on my body. So it has four different tools showing you exactly just like a graph who's going to be a leader in the industry. I went ahead and actually looked at exactly researchers.

Now, I would love to talk about our cost optimization tools. The first being the it budget tool. Now you have a $7 million budget and you'd like to reduce that by 350,000, which is really important. What we're going to do is send you a survey, it's going to be line by line dissecting your whole budget.

Year two, the R I dipped a little bit, but that's only because we found so much savings in year one. But what's great as you see by year four, we were able to bring it right back up to 16%. And we were to do that by being able to take your it budget and turning into a revenue driver investing in those technologies that are going to help you long term.

I know you mentioned 32 them, but maybe the important ones who need to make the decisions quickly will be able to have access to any report you run.

Well, again, I know I gave you a brief overview on Gartner earlier, but I just want to emphasize that again, we are the world's largest research and advisory firm and we service over 15,000 client organizations in 100 countries around the world. And we pride ourselves on having our unbiased nature in order to deliver the most reliable and accurate results to our clients. And what I have to show you today is a product called Gartner for C I. And um it is very applicable. Sorry words are hard today. Apparently for you as the director of technology as well. It's made up of these three components, research component, a cost optimization component and an executive partner component. First, I want to direct your attention towards this research component because I know you mentioned how important it is that you implement Microsoft Dynamics effectively and efficiently. So like I mentioned, um Gartner has the world's largest research repository and just to show you how easy it is to access that I would like to show you what it would look like if you signed with Gartner and use your user name and password to log in to Gartner's research portal. If you would like to expand your knowledge on a certain topic, what you would do is go to Gartner's search bar right there and I'm actually gonna have you type in Microsoft Dynamics. There we go. And as you can see that pulled up over 600 results all relating to that topic and these results are going to be much more specialized and relevant and reliable than say the results that you would be receiving from Google would be because these best practices do comments and articles are all placed in Gartner's research repository by our analysts and are peer reviewed by our analysts as well. So you can be sure that you're going to be directed towards the most accurate and needed information you need in a much more timely manner.

And you can do that by starting with using our magic quadrant. And this is going to outline right in front of your eyes, any vendors you may need to use to develop some scripts and be able to test Microsoft dynamics to make sure that it is absolutely right for your company, how do you think you would use information like this to be able to see any other options you might need to use for the implementation?",

First in this tool is the it budget tool and that is going to allow you to benchmark your current it spending across industry averages and competitor averages to see specific areas where you might be spending too much. How do you see yourself using that benchmarking information to decrease costs?",

    },
    {
      "transcript chunk": "SalesPerson 00:12:55.770\nAnd it's a very easy process. I would like you to know that it all starts with a questionnaire that I would send you and have you fill out, which is going to tell us where exactly you're allocating your it budget, your it budget. And then what Gartner is going to do with that is they're going to compile a report and you're going to see in that report a page like this where it breaks down line by line your budget into these specific metrics. So you're going to see exactly how you line up again to the competitors and the industry and be able to drive down your costs from there. Does this give you a better idea of what something like that would look like? Ok. And then another way that you would be able to drive down costs is through Gartner's contract review. And this is when Gartner analysts take your current vendor contracts and they're going to analyze them to identify cost savings as well in 15 or I'm sorry. In 75% of the contracts that Gartner reviews. We see anywhere between 15 and 20% cost savings. So how much would you say your vendor contracts are right now?",
      "trait": "Conscientiousness"
    },
    {
      "transcript chunk": "Buyer 00:13:57.270\nUm We have three different vendor contracts that we work with. This is not something that's top of mind because they don't really need to be renewed until next year. But um IBM is about 300,000. Click is about 250,000 and VM Ware is about 350,000.",
      "trait": "Conscientiousness"
    },
    {
      "transcript chunk": "SalesPerson 00:14:13.099\nOk. So just for the case of rounding today, let's say that's about roughly 500,000 and take that at minimum multiplied by 50 15% and that's already $75,000 worth of savings. Take that multiplied by all of your contracts and that's going to be an excellent way that you're gonna be able to drive down those costs even more. And with the combination of these 22 tools, you are most definitely going to be able to meet that goal of driving down costs by 5% so that you can then allocate that money to the necessary hiring that you need. How do you see these two tools helping you move through your tasks in order to achieve them?",

      "transcript chunk": "Buyer 00:14:50.239\nI understand the concept of it. It's, it's high level, I just need to understand it specifically for, for our company's numbers, of course, and that is exactly what we would be able to do knowing um, once we are able to send out that questionnaire and get your numbers, um we will better be able to explain exactly how much we're gonna help you decrease those costs by.",

    {
      "transcript chunk": "SalesPerson 00:15:12.349\nUm But of course, I don't know your numbers today, but do you see the value um based on these averages and the proven return on investment that you're going to get that? I've explained today how Gartner can help you. Sure. So what would be your recommendation about Gartner then based on the tools that I've given you and helping you achieve your goals, what do you mean would you consider moving forward with Gartner based on the value and the tools that I've shown you today? What's the price? Of course, I know price is a big aspect of this and it is very easy to understand in this visual. Um If you as the director of technology want soul access, then it's going to be for the first year $50,000 which I'd like to point out as we talked about using that vendor contract review, you're going to be able to already get at least $75,000 worth of savings on just one contract review. So you're going to be able to get that return on investment back by a lot.",

Um So looking at this, I see it's a multiyear agreement correct? Three years. OK. So I'm just not interested in the multiyear agreement. And why is that? The reason being is because I'm focused on that Microsoft Dynamics and everything I'm implementing is for this year. So I just need to worry about this year and that's it. OK.",
      "trait": "Conscientiousness"

    {
      "transcript chunk": "SalesPerson 00:16:30.510\nSo you just want one year as far as this goes. OK. Well, unfortunately, we cannot alter that. It is a three year agreement no matter what. But the reason that is is because Gartner so committed to growth and innovation that we are constantly growing and providing you with more value and more resources. I know it may seem like now that you only need this for one year, but it's always a great opportunity to be able to decrease costs because with that go live date of Microsoft Dynamics being in 2020 who knows what's going to happen? Once that goes live, you might need to hire more people. You might need to align your budget to other areas which is going to require more cost savings. And through this cost optimization tool, I know you said you don't need those vendor contracts reviewed, but it's going to give you the cost savings that you need and that's going to be something that continues into the future through the three years. And after that, do you see how that would bring you value more than just one year? Yeah, I understand what you're saying.",

But again, I explained that you're going to get that return on investment because clients, especially in your industry, always with my experience do get that return on investment. And um you don't have to worry about losing that return on investment through other ways and it's going to be able to also save you time and allow you to assign that time to the other task you need to focus on. Does that clarify your concern? Sure. Ok. So with that said, now that you understand price and we've agreed that Garner can definitely bring Tobu value.
